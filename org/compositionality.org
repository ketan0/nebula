#+title: compositionality

You have a set of reusable pieces that can be combined to form different, interesting things.

* Decomposition of [[id:0997b060-ee05-458e-beed-3494675c879d][programs]] into modular, reusable unit is one example of this.

* Some methodical activities, such as making breakfast, decompose well into modular activities as well:

* A [[id:5b02540a-15ac-4123-86f8-e6ca5420ce27][machine learning]] example of compositionality
is that a [[id:27d08270-d161-4bb1-8b39-50f28b1ab668][computer vision]] model's early layers will implement an edge detector, curve detector, etc., which are modular pieces that are then combined in various ways by higher-level layers to form dog detectors, car detectors, etc.

But ultimately the ways in which machine learning models, at the moment, can "intelligently" combine different pieces and parts is limited. See the tweet about DALL-E trying to stack blocks, bless its heart:

One step towards compositionality is the idea of neuro-symbolic models. Combining logic-based systems with connectionist methods.

* compositionality in the human mind
how do our brains combine simple concepts into more complex ones? Even though the input we receive is noisy and finite, we can (in theory) produce an unbounded number of sentences. [[https://reddit.com/r/BrandNewSentence][r/BrandNewSentence]] is an entertaining example of this.
