#+title: binary space partitioning the world

the world is divided into 4 quadrants: =00=, =01=, =10=, and =11= (starting with the top left, then top right, then bottom left, then bottom right.) each of those is divided into 4 quadrants, and so on. we can represent any location on earth as a string of =0='s and =1='s, where each 2 bits represents a quadrant.

for example, my childhood home is at =0011000000111011000000= (last few bits left off for privacy...)
mt everest is around =011001111101000101=

have at it~ inspired by the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUF5esTscZI][CGP Grey A4 paper video]]
metanote; while i was writing this note, copilot gave me the following suggestion:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px :alt copilot's suggestion to me
[[file:copilot_creepy.png]]

Which...not only is a valid youtube video, but *it's a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4][3blue1brown video on the very topic of fractals]].* Before I'd even written the word fractal, or self-similar,  or anything in this document. Kinda crazy, right?

* fun observations / thoughts
- the world is in the order of magnitude 2^34 larger than my house.
- you can really see how messed up the Mercator is by the shapes of the quadrants in the far north
- many different ways we could do this-- just have to map a different fractal onto a different projection. e.g. we could do Sierpinski fractals on top of Buckminster Fuller's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map][Dymaxion map]], or hexagons, because, you know, they're the bestagons (@cgpgrey).
- If you live in two different places, what's your Last Common Ancestor in the binary tree?
