Thinking about the [[id:091329e5-7896-4975-b88b-99b30f4dd482][philosophy]] of how we should live our lives.

Some guiding principles:

- [[id:0dc3bc78-df96-4240-a6be-beb71e6074cc][simplicity]]
- joy
- truly 'following my nose' / letting bottom-up curiosity take me places
- focus your time and energy on what you want to see more of
- active/outward kindess
