#+title: digital garden architecture considerations

* how can we move beyond having to explictly link nodes?
obvious answer is to use some sort of semantic similarity to find similar notes -- but these links will probably be fairly obvious connections...

the cool part would be to find the true, but non-obvious connections between notes.
* how can we utilize transclusion more powerfully? i.e. having strong "atoms" / building blocks that i can transpose in a lot of other contexts, the way that visakanv does by QTing his evergreen tweets ([[https://x.com/visakanv/status/1443196315970670598?s=20][ayy lmao]], [[https://x.com/visakanv/status/1095744739410759680?s=20][fuckable > fucked]], etc.) i think those koan-like atoms are super duper powerful. and it's spaced repetition!
