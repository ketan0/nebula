#+title: writing

I kinda want to get back into longform writing. Right now, my digital garden is a sort of 'junkyard' of interesting nodes, but nothing super...coherent. There are some really exemplary blog posts, by people like Michael Nielsen, that I'd like to emulate.

I'd also love to get feedback on my writing from others. I feel that could be pretty useful.
