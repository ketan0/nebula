I think it can be really good. Fairly related to <a href="compositionality.html#ID-b6fafba6-8e57-400d-962c-bf7cc892a41f">compositionality</a>. Will have to hash out what I think the difference is there.<br />
</p>

<p>
<a href="emacs.html#ID-1999996d-b676-4fc4-894b-caf82f8dd7ff">♏️ emacs</a> gets a lot of its power from its modularity. Packages are just little pieces of code&#x2013; you can add/remove them into your ecosystem as you please. As opposed to proprietary software, where you may be much more limited in the customization that you can do&#x2026;one piece of functionality for Evernote might not carry over to VSCode might not carry over to your web browser. etc.<br />
</p>

<p>
^it&rsquo;s beautiful chaos sometimes, though! Modules designed by tens of thousands of independent humans are bound to be overlapping, redundant, and sometimes confusing to &ldquo;glue together&rdquo;&#x2026;<br />

<p>
Despite reading explanations and guides occasionally, I&rsquo;ve never understood how Org, BibTeX, org-ref, ebib, etc. all work together. I once tried to set them up using BibTeX references in a file, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to figure out how to get citations working. I ran out of time to fiddle with it and had to do all the citations manually. :(<br />

<p>
Well&#x2026; They do not. It&rsquo;s up to the end users glue them together. Bib(La)TeX only take care of record books&amp;c references in a textual flat-file database, org-ref is mostly a helper to add things to that text db and quickly link a record in an org documents, helm-bibtex or ivy-bibtex are the search-based UI to operate with.<br />

so, one reason i like emacs is that it provides an incredibly powerful set of primitives for editing text. these primitives are not just confined to the &rsquo;writing app&rsquo; or the &rsquo;coding app&rsquo; (though there is not really such a thing as an ‘app’ in emacs), but rather they are present throughout the whole system. kinda like how cmd-C and cmd-V work in every app, but generalized.<br />

<p>
examples:<br />

<p>
you have primitives for things like deleting, uppercasing, highlighting, jumping up and down, creating a new line, recording a sequence of actions and replaying those back later…all the things that would be useful when editing text. and each of these primitives can be applied dynamically to a range of characters<br />
</p>

<p>
but then, perhaps even cooler, is that these primitives are like LEGO blocks, or maybe more aptly described like Play-Doh. they can be molded, composed, replaced, or extended into anything the end-user.<br />
