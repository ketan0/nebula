-Bezos. This gets at the dynamism of problem-solving that I stumbled upon that summer of 2019 doing research in Mike&rsquo;s lab; sometimes I&rsquo;d give up too soon / flip between 10 different approaches impatiently, and on the other hand sometimes I would bang my head trying to get a particular solution to work. so&#x2026;what&rsquo;s the cause here?<br />

<p>
i think first of all, immaturity in the field played a big role. but also, i think as you go on, there&rsquo;s just this &rsquo;awareness&rsquo; / metacognitive skill you develop to be able to dig yourself out of things.<br />
