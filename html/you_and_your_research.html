Some great advice on how to do effective <a href="research.html#ID-283dc18a-8b0e-4d9a-94c8-898c5ff04437">research</a>.<br />

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a> gave a talk that&rsquo;s gained an increasing cult following in recent years. Drawing on his experience from Bell Labs, he lists some the characteristics of the top researchers there (including himself.)<br />

<p>
I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don&rsquo;t know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.<br />

<p>
Early on it became evident to me that Bell Laboratories was not going to give me the conventional acre of programming people to program computing machines in absolute binary. It was clear they weren&rsquo;t going to. But that was the way everybody did it. I could go to the West Coast and get a job with the airplane companies without any trouble, but the exciting people were at Bell Labs and the fellows out there in the airplane companies were not. I thought for a long while about, &ldquo;Did I want to go or not?&rdquo; and I wondered how I could get the best of two possible worlds. I finally said to myself, &ldquo;Hamming, you think the machines can do practically everything. Why can&rsquo;t you make them write programs?&rdquo; What appeared at first to me as a defect forced me into automatic programming very early.<br />

<p>
&ldquo;Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.&rdquo; Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest.<br />

One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them.<br />

<p>
If you do not work on an important problem, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll do important work. It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious. Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them.<br />
